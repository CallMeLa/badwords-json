# badwords-json

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

  badwords-json is for those who need a quick go-to text file containing some of the most explicit, profound, offensive, and otherwise problematic words or phrases.
  Be warned, some of the words and phrases inside of the badwords.json file can contain racist, sexist, and all other types of extremely offensive slurs.
  The badwords.json file was made to allow Discord server owners or bot developers to easily remove most of the toxicity from their platforms.
  It can also be used for many other things. Credit to those from my [Discord community](https://discord.gg/FhTgqtarZJ) for helping create this list. ‚ù§
